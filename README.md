Objective:  
Clean and preprocess the TrueCar dataset to ensure it is suitable for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling.
The 
Steps I have done and recommended to do.

1. Data Cleaning:
   - I have removed duplicate records.
   - Handled missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation or removal).
   - Identified and treated outliers using appropriate methods (e.g., z-score, IQR).
2. Feature Engineering:
   -I have created new features like "Car Age" derived from "Year of Manufacture."
   - Transformed continuous variables as needed (e.g., log transformation to handle skewness).

3. Data Transformation:
   - Normalized  numerical features to ensure uniformity.
   - Encoded categorical variables using suitable methods (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

4. Data Validation:
   -  I have verified data types and ensured all features are correctly formatted for further analysis.
   - Ensure that no data leakage could affect model performance.

5. Documentation:
   - Made  a cleaned and preprocessed dataset in  CSV below.

Tools and Resources:
- Python (pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn) for data preprocessing.
- Jupyter Notebook to document code and observations.

  FILES:
  -I have attached the text file, in which the process was done in a Jupyter notebook.
